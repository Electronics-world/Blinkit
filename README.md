# Blinkit



Steem notification software that notifies you in "real-time" with sound and light about Steem account activity.
The light notifications are realised with the use of a regular USB stick, by writing to the stick and activating the led when new steem activities are detected.

Installation instructions for Windows

1. Download the content of the Blinkit folder here on github and copy it into c:\blinkit
2. Start the Blinkit interface with blinkit.exe  
3. Enter your Steem username and press save.
4. Select your USB drive letter and press save.
5. Everything is ready, the program and buttons to test the led and watch for Steem activities can now be used.
